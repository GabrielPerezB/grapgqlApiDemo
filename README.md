# GraphQL

* **What is GraphQL**:
    - Stateless, client-independent API for exchanging data with higher query flexibility
    - It's a normal Node(+ Express) Server
    - ONE Single endpoint POST/graphql
    - Uses POST because Request Body defines Data Structure of retrieved Data
    - Server-side Resolver analyses Request Body, Fetches and Prepares and Returns Data
    - Operation Types:
        - Query -> Retrive Data ("GET")
        - Mutation -> Manipulate Data ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE")
        - Suscription -> Set up realtime connection via Websockets
